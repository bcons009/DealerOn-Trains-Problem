# DealerOn-Trains-Problem
My solution for the Trains problem presented in the DealerOn Development Candidate Coding Test.

## Design Explanation

## Assumptions regarding User Input
* The program reads the  `input.txt` file in the `DealerOn Trains Problem` directory to get the user's input. The user is free to make any changes to the text file to edit their input to the program.
* All input must be a list of strings, with each string in the format of `XYn`: `X` and `Y` being any two letters in the alphabet, and `n` being any integer. Each string in this list must be separated by a comma.
** If these input conditions are not met, the program will detect that the input is improperly formatted and will throw an error warning the user of their input's formatting.
